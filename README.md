# Skraper Video Encoder

This is a tool that AI wrote for me, I've been doing similar for quite a few years via a simple batch script but thought I'd ask the nice AI man/women/they/them to create a python script with GUI.

I originally started doing this to the Skraper snaps years ago as I had a few Raspberry Pi Zero handhelds, they couldnt play the videos generated so I used to reduce the size from 640x480 to 320x240 to allow the struggling processor to play the videos. It worked very well and I've been reducing the video size ever since but these days its mostly to save space since the video snaps tend to be a lot bigger than the actual games themselves and since I mostly use handhelds, I dont really need 480p videos! so I've been reducing to 240p as well as the video lengh to 20 seconds from 30.

The interface is simple, just choose a directory and then select your options. If you're unsure, choose 'Save to 'trimmed' sub folder' so you can check and then overwrite but if you're sure, then choose the Overwrite originals option. Go over to the releases section for the standalone .exe version. FFMPEG should be included in the package, it seems to work for me but I've included in the downloads incase its required. The .py version should work on other operating systems or so AI advised anyway!
